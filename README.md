### Post-Platform (With Analytics)
- Decision lag time: **Real-time** (dashboard-driven)
- Revenue optimization: **Data-driven dynamic pricing**
- Fleet utilization: **Target 80-85%** (demand forecasting)
- Customer wait times: **Tracked and improving**

### Expected Impact (First Year)
- **10-15% revenue increase** from dynamic pricing
- **15-20% fleet efficiency improvement** from demand prediction
- **20% reduction in wait times** from zone optimization
- **$500K-$1M cost savings** from operational efficiency
